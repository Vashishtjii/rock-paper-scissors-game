This is a fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game built in Python. The game is played between the user and the computer, with the goal of winning the best of 3 rounds. The player is prompted to enter their choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors", while the computer randomly selects its move. The game keeps track of the score, displays the winner of each round, and announces the final winner once either the player or the computer wins 2 rounds. It also handles invalid input and allows the user to quit or replay the game. This project is great for beginners learning about conditionals, loops, functions, and basic user interaction in Python.
